      <h1>Best Things To Eat</h1>
      <h3><img src="images/best things to eat/yogurt.jpg" alt="yogurt" width="250" height="250" class="insertimage" />1. Yogurt </h3>
      <p>Research shows yogurt may protect against gum disease. Left unchecked, gum disease may elevate a person’s risk for heart disease. Researchers from Japan analyzed dietary intakes from nearly 1,000 adults and found those who consumed the highest levels of dairy—specifically yogurt and yogurt-type drinks—had the healthiest gums. Their report, published in the Journal of Periodontology, credits probiotics (a.k.a. “good bacteria”) as one possible champion of gum health. Experts believe that probiotics may help to counter growth of the “unfriendly” bacteria in the mouth. Probiotics are live active cultures used to ferment foods, such as yogurt and kefir (fermented milk), and studies suggest that they may improve digestion and boost immunity too. As for gum health, it’s not yet clear how much yogurt (or other fermented dairy foods) one needs to consume to reap the benefits, says Yoshihiro Shimazaki, D.D.S., Ph.D., of Kyushu University, the study’s lead author.</p>
      <h3><img src="images/best things to eat/raisins.jpg" alt="raisins" width="250" height="250" class="insertimage" />2. Raisins </h3>
      <p>Research has shown that antioxidants in raisins fight the growth of a type of bacteria that can cause inflammation and gum disease. People with gum disease—which affects up to 50 percent of American adults—are twice as likely to suffer from heart problems. So, dealing with one can help people avoid the other. Last summer, a major heart journal and a major periodontal journal simultaneously published a consensus paper that outlines the link between the two diseases: inflammation. As a result, choosing certain foods, such as raisins, may help you protect both your gums and your heart.</p>
      <h3><img src="images/best things to eat/grains.jpg" alt="grains" width="250" height="250" class="insertimage" />3. Whole Grains</h3>
      <p> People who eat plenty of whole grains tend to be leaner and have a lower risk of heart disease than those who don’t. This is probably because whole grains contain antioxidants, phytoestrogens and phytosterols that are protective against coronary disease.</p>
      <h3><img src="images/best things to eat/salmon.jpg" alt="salmon" width="250" height="250" class="insertimage" /></h3>
      <h3>4. Salmon/Fish </h3>
      <p>Consuming two or more servings of fish per week is associated with a 30 percent lower risk of developing coronary heart disease over the long term, studies show. Fish—especially “oily” kinds, such as salmon and tuna—contain omega-3 fats, which lower levels of triglycerides in the blood that may contribute to blood clotting. Omega-3s also lower blood pressure slightly and can help prevent irregular heart rhythms. No common fish delivers more of the omega-3 fatty acids than salmon. Flaxseed oil, canola oil and walnuts also contain omega-3 fats. </p>
